# Introduction

This report analyses the security and usability trade-offs of ChatGPT, an AI assistant created by the AI and research company, OpenAI on November 30th of 2022. This product will be evaluated using the security-usability threat modeling approach as proposed by the Kainda [@kainda2010]. This is a suitable framework, as it helps to identify the frictions between both the security and usability for legitimate users by considering appropriate usage scenarios, as opposed to the potential threat scenarios that could also arise due to probable user mistakes.
